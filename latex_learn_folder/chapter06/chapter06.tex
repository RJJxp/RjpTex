    It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so. far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

\begin{verse}
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood\\
    And sorry I could not travel both\\
    And be one traveler, long I stood\\
    And looked down one as far as I could
    % blank line seperates different stanzas

    To where it bent in the undergrowth\\
    Then took the other, as just as fair\\*
    % enable couplets in the same page
    And having perhaps the better claim\\
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear\\[5pt]
    % control the distance between lines
    Thoug has for that the passing there\\
    Had worn them really about the same\\
    And both that morning equally lay\\
    In leaves no step had trodden black\\
    Oh,I kept the first for another day!\\
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way\\
    I doubted if I should ever come back\\
    I shall be telling this with a sigh\\
    Somewhere ages and ages hence\\
    Two roads diverged in a wood,and Iâ€”\\
    I took the one less traveled by\\
    And that has made all the difference

The real number $l$ is the least upper bound of the set $A$ if it satisfies the following conditions 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(1)] $l$ is an upper bound of $A$
	\item[(2)] $2$ if $u$ is an upper bound of $A$, then $l\le u$  
\end{enumerate}
The second condition is equivalent to 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(2)$'$] If $a<l$, then $a$ is not an upper bound of $A$
