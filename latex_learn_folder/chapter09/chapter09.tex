How does a theorem's style is determinated?

Command {\itshape \textbackslash theoremstyle} 's scope will not end until a new {\itshape \textbackslash theoremstyle} shows up. All the style of these theorems defined by {\itshape \textbackslash newtherom} command in the scope of corresponding {\itshape \textbackslash theoremstyle} command.

So assume there are 2 {\itshape \textbackslash theoremstyle} commands {\rmfamily s1, s2} and theorem {\rmfamily s1\_t1, s1\_t2} defined in {\rmfamily s1}, theorem {\rmfamily s2\_t1} defined in {\rmfamily s2}. When you wirte {\rmfamily s1\_t2} after {\rmfamily s2}, {\rmfamily s1\_t2} is still the type of {\rmfamily s1}, though there is already a command setting a new theoremstyle.

\begin{numfirstthm}[Euclid]
    The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180Ë†\circ$
\end{numfirstthm}

\begin{proof} 
    Let $\{p_1,p_2,\dotsc p_k\}$ be a finite set of primes. Define $n=p_1p_2\dotsm p_k+1$. Then either $n$ itself is a prime or has a prime factor. Now $n$ is neither equal to nor is divisible by any of the primes $p_1,p_2,\dotsc p_k$ so that in either case, we get a prime different from $p_1,p_2,\dotsc p_k$. Thus no finite set of primes can include all the primes.
\end{proof}
